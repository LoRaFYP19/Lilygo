This is the code for the **End nodes** and **intermediate** gateway nodes.

We are using the Lilygo v2.1_1.6 ESP32 based LoRa development boards as our end devices and intermediate gateways. These boards are designed specifically for LoRa communication and are equipped with an ESP32 microcontroller.

The Lilygo v2.1_1.6 boards support the 923MHz frequency band, which is commonly used for LoRa communication in certain regions. They provide a reliable and long-range wireless communication solution for our IoT applications.

As end devices, these boards are used to collect earthquake status data from Raspberry Shake devices. The Raspberry Shake is a seismograph device that detects and records earthquakes.

To send earthquake status from the Raspberry Shake devices, we need to establish a serial communication between the Lilygo v2.1_1.6 boards and the Raspberry Shake devices.
